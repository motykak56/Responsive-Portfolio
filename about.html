              <p class="card-text">I have attended some fine institutions of learning.  And I've learned a great deal in the process.  Having two undergraduate degrees, one in Engineering and the other in Music, I've got a well-rounded education in both science and the arts.  </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">I've worked at a host of different companies....small, medium and large.</h5>
              <p class="card-text">I have however been fired from the past 3 jobs I've held.  I always end up upsetting the apple cart by questioning the status quo.  I have come to the conclusion that it's time to quit working for other people and start working for myself.  I'm way too independent of a thinker to work for others and I'm getting more so as I get older. I've waited a very long time for this and I'm excited about it. My big-picture ideas will no longer be thwarted by others.  I will be solely responsible for them.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Musician to Engineer to Web Developer</h5>
                <p class="card-text">I went into music as a profession quite by accident.  My parents told me I had to get a scholarship in order to go away to college and a music scholarship was easy to come by.  I was talented as a musician and I just got sucked in.  I went into Engineering because I wanted to be respected on the job and I figured I could get the degree if I worked hard enough.  I am now going into Web Development because I want to do the work.  I like coding.  I can do it for hours on end and never tire of it.  I believe I'm properly motivated this time and with enough hard work I will become talented at this as well.  It's an outlet for my energy and it opens the door allowing me to do interesting things in my solitude which I value so much.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">My Family</h5>
              <p class="card-text">I don't have much family I'm close to especially now that my mother is gone.  I have a beloved granddaughter and grandson.  They're 3 and 2 years old and cute as buttons.  I have one child, a son who has been cruel to me since he was 11 years old and never got over it.  He is what stands between me and knowing my grandchildren.  I have an uncle in Miami who is 93 years old and precious to me.  I have a sister and three nieces...I love my nieces as if they were my own daughters but they all have their own lives now.  I have one ex husband who is a god-send in time of need.  He's one of the most helpful people in my life...no regrets about the divorce but he's an excellent human being all around yet he has a live-in girlfriend so I'm careful how often I contact him and for what reason.   I want to respect their relationship.  Finally, I would be wrong to omit my 2 dogs: Peppa and Parker who love me unconditionally and I them.  They are my immediate family and provide me a fullness I wouldn't have without them.  So that's my family.  A bit dysfunctional but probably most American families are.

              <p class="card-text">I want to retire in Canada.  I want to own and run my own web business.  I want to brush up on my Turkish and visit Istanbul.  I want to live on a farm so my dogs can run and own my own horse so I can go riding when I please. I want to see the New York City Ballet, hear the New York Philharmonic live and I want to experience a live concert at Carnegie Hall where it is said the acoustics are second to none. I want to spend a month in Paris and spend all my time in the museums getting passes to go day after day and see everything there is to see in them.</p>
